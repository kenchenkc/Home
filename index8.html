		<p class = "reg">The Boreal Shield is full of fun things to do! In Ontario, there is the Algonquin Park. This park is so big that it is almost as large as the states 
		Delaware & Rhode Island combined. Imagine all of the wildlife and nature just waiting for you to come and visit! At Algonquin Park, you can canoe and fish. If you really 
		want, you can even camp there for a night or two! You can also visit the Gros Morne National park of Newfoundland! There is the infamous site, L'Anse aux Meadows, where the 
		Vikings built the very first European settlement. It is almost like taking a time machine back to the 10th century! But that&#39;s not all that Gros Morne National park has to 
		offer. There you can decide to take a dip in the many beaches and coastlines or watch a live theatrical act!</p>

		<p class = "reg">The most visited place in Ottawa is probably the Parliament Hill. In fact, 3 million people visit &quot;The Hill&quot; (common nickname) annually. In The Hill, you 
		can discover the history, functions and art of Canada&#39;s Parliament. Another premiere destination in Ottawa is the Byward Market. Here, you can shop, dine, appreciate art, 
		and enjoy the fantastic environment. </p>

		<p class = "reg">One of the most unique souvenirs to buy in St. John&#39;s is the Jellybean Row. In a nutshell, the Jellybean Row is a series of art prints based on actual 
		homes on the oldest streets of North America. If you&#39;re a history buff that loves the railway and water transportation, you must visit the Railway Coastal Museum. Inside, you will find working models of 
		trains, boats, and dioramas that will uncover the story of Newfoundland&#39;s railway and coastal boats.</p>
