		<p class = "reg">There is so much to say about the different kinds of vegetation in the Boreal Shield! Not only are there coniferous trees, but also there are deciduous trees 
		(mostly in the south)! Many different kinds of coniferous trees grow in the Boreal Shield. Black spruce, white spruce, Jack pine, and balsam fir are only some examples. But 
		let’s not forget about the deciduous trees. To the south, there are white birch, trembling aspen and balsam poplar trees. In the east there are yellow birch and sugar maple 
		trees, which is used to make Canada’s world famous maple syrup.</p>

		<p class = "reg">Ottawa’s vegetation region is in the Mixed Forest region. The Mixed Forest region stretches all across Canada, touching almost every single province and 
		territory. The vegetation in Ottawa is mainly composed of coniferous, deciduous, evergreen trees, and shrubs as well. Other than trees and shrubs, there are also ferns, 
		grasses, and green, leafy plants in Ottawa.</p>

		the trees are ash and elm. Near the middle and west of the city, there are yellow birch and white pine trees. In the lowlands, there are generally only Balsam fir and black 
		spruce trees, but in the northeast, where the weather is cooler, aspen and paper birch inhabit the area.</p>
