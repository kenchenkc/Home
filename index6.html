		<p class = "reg">The soil in the Boreal Shield is heavily leached. This kind of soil occurs where there is a great deal of precipitation. When the water moves downwards, the 
		chemical nutrients is dissolved and gets carried away. Furthermore, this ecozone is full of swampy areas, bare rock, and the topsoil is incredibly thin and poor.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular"><a id = "boreal"></a>Ottawa and St. John's</h2>
		<p class = "reg">In Ottawa and St. Johnâ€™s, the soil is very fertile. This kind of soil can support farming and varieties of wildlife. Fertile soil contains all the major 
		nutrients needed for a plant to grow. These nutrients can include mineral materials and organic materials, such as humus.</p>
